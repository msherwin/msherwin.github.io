			<h1 class="blog-post-title">Things I Like</h1>
			<h3>Books</h3>
			<ul>
			   <li><dt><i>Game of Thrones</i> (Series) by George R. Martin</dt>
				<dd>Best world-building and plotting in all of the fantasy genre. 'Nuff said. Tyrione is my bff.</dd>
			   </li>
			   <li><dt><i>The Kingkiller Chronicles</i> (Series) by Patrick Rothfuss</dt>
				<dd>The first book in the series, <i>Name of the Wind</i>, is hands down the greatest fantasy novel I've ever read (the second was also great, and I'm waiting on the third). The magic system is the most coherent and interesting of any book I've read (or anything else really). Sort of like a fantasy version of <i>Ender's Game</i>, but better.</dd>
			   </li>
			   <li><dt><i>American Gods</i> by Neil Gaiman</dt>
				<dd>Did I say something about the greatest fantasy novel ever? Well, this is urban-fantasy (i.e., set in the present day) so I refuse to compare them. After the rise of existentialism during WWII, no one believes in gods anymore. Without belief, their powers wane, so they try to make a new life for themselves in America. A lot of the themes were probably borrowed from one-time collaborator Terry Pratchett...</dd>
			   </li>
			   <li><dt><i>The Discworld Series</i> by Terry Pratchett</dt>
				<dd>Discworld is too big for me to describe here, but suffise to say that they are simultaneously the funniest and most profound books I've read (collectively, there are a few duds). Start with <i>Guards,Guards</i>, the Watch arc is the best intro to the series IMO.</dd>
			   </li>
			   <li><dt><i>The Road</i> by Cormac McCarthy</dt>
				<dd>As an on-again, mostly off-again writer, this book literally instills fear in me. Like the Ozymandias, look-upon-my-works-and-despair kind of fear. You will never, ever read better, more beautiful prose. And you certainly won't write it. Also, you'll probably cry.</dd>
			   </li>
			   <li><dt><i>Gödel, Escher, and Bach: An Eternal Golden</i> by Douglas Hofstdater</dt>
				<dd>Spoilers: it's about math. But also a lot of other stuff, like history, art, and music. If you want to know why all mathematical systems are inherently flawed and lord it over your mathy friends (and also be able to say you read a Pulitzer Prize-winning work of non-fiction) read this book. But seriously, it's a lot of work, but worth it if you have any interest in math or logic.</dd>
			   </li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Anime</h3>
			  <ul>
			    <li><dt><i>Nausicaa: The Valley of the Wind</i> by Hayao Myazaki</dt>
				<dd>This list could be nothing but Myazaki movies really, but I watched this movie when I was like 6 years old, and it is still one of my favorites. For me, it perfectly captures the nature of nature: beautiful and horrifying in equal measure. Joe Hisaishi's scoring in this movie is some of the most beautiful music I've ever heard.</dd>
			    </li>
			    <li><dt><i>Hunter x Hunter</i></dt>
				<dd>Despite them being terrible shows, I still like DBZ, Bleach, Naruto, and One Piece. Like those shows, HxH is a battle anime. Unlike those shows, it's amazing. It starts out slow, but every single arc is substantially better than the last. It's got great characterization and plotting that doesn't insult your intelligence. HxH is the Shakespeare of action anime.</dd>
			    </li>
			    <li><dt><i>Madoka Magica</i></dt>
				<dd>You have to have watched a lot of anime to appreciate this, since it's a deconstruction of common tropes. This is his seminal work, but every single show directed by Gen Urobuchi is amazing. Also highly recommend Psycho-Pass, Suisei no Gargantia, and Fate/Zero.</dd>
			    </li>
			    <li><dt><i>Monogatari</i></dt>
				<dd>Best described as "conversation porn". Monogatari has the best dialogue of any show I've ever seen.</dd>
			    </li>
			    <li><dt><i>Mushishi</i></dt>
				<dd>About a traveling doctor who helps people deal with weird supernatural creatures called mushi. Mushishi is the most peaceful and relaxing show I've ever seen. It's just beautiful.</dd>
			    </li>
			    <li><dt><i>Samurai Champloo / Rourouni Kenshin</i></dt>
				<dd>I can't decide which of these samurai anime is better, so just know that they're both fantastic. Especially the Kenshin Trust and Betrayal OVA. Samurai Champloo for the fights, Kenshin for the characters and music.</dd>
			    </li>
			    <li><dt><i>Gintama</i></dt>
				<dd>It doesn't hit its stride until all of its massive list of characters is introduced, but it's the funniest anime ever. Also, the few serious arcs give the samurai anime I just listed a run for their money.</dd>
			    </li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Video Games</h3>
			  <ul>
			    <li><dt>Super Smash Bros. Melee</dt>
				<dd>I play Brawl. I also eat hot pockets, but they don't sustain me. Ganondorf is my main man. Wizard stomp every day.</dd>
			    </li>
			    <li><dt>Final Fantasy X</dt>
				<dd>I probably only love this game so much because it was the first Final Fantasy game I played, but whatever. Tidus is the worst human to ever exist in fiction or real life, but this game had the best gameplay and summons.</dd>
			    </li>
			    <li><dt>Portal</dt>
				<dd>Self-explanatory. Ground-breaking, all game developers should aspire to, etc.</dd>
			    </li>
			    <li><dt>FTL: Faster Than Light</dt>
				<dd>I play this game because I hate myself.</dd>
			    </li>
			    <li><dt>Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker and Majora's Mask</dt>
				<dd>These are the best LoZ games, I'm sorry. They're just great.</dd>
			    </li>
			    <li><dt>Dark Souls</dt>
				<dd>See FTL. Actually, though, this is just a beautiful game. It's incredibly hard, but almost never unfair. Except for those damn archers in Anor Lando...</dd>
			    </li>
			    <li><dt>Shadow of the Colossus</dt>
				<dd>I wish I could forget this game completely, so that I could experience it again for the first time. So great.</dd>
			    </li>
			    <li><dt>Castlevania IV</dt>
				<dd>This was the first video game I ever played. I remember watching my parents play it when I was like 5, and the day that my mom beat it. I used to pretend I was Simon Belmont, smacking a halloween prop skeleton with a jump rope. This was the last non-Metroidy Castlevania game, and it will always be near and dear to me.</dd>
			    </li>
			    <li><dt>Megaman X</dt>
				<dd>Another amazing game from my childhood. If you don't understand how great this game is, then let <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FpigqfcvlM&feature=kp">Egoraptor</a> explain it to you. Actually, play it first, then Egoraptor.</dd>
			    </li>
			    <li><dt>Pokemon</dt>
				<dd>Did you know that if you catch all the pokemon, you'll never have to pax taxes ever again? That's true. Btw, venusaur is the best.</dd>
